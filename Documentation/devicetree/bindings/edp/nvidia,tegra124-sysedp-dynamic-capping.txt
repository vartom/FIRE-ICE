System-EDP Consumers:

Required properties:
- compatible: "nvidia,tegra124-sysedp-dynamic-capping"
- nvidia,corecap: This is an array of tegra_sysedp_corecap structs. The order
  and contents of each corecap line refers to a unsigned int value inside the
  tegra_sysedp_corecap struct.  Here's the order of the values expected per
  line of data:
	- AP power (milliwatts): Power required by the AP+DRAM when the CPU power
	  and GPU and EMC frequencies are capped.
	- CPU Priority CPU Max Power (milliwatts): Maximum power given to the CPU
	  when the CPU has the priority.
	- CPU Priority GPU Max Frequency (kHz) (or Max Power (mW)): Maximum GPU
	  frequency (or power) allowed when the CPU has the priority. (See
	  nvidia,gpu_cap_as_mw).
	- CPU Priority EMC Max Frequency (kHz): Maximum EMC frequency allowed when
	  the CPU has the priority.
	- GPU Priority CPU Max Power (milliwatts): Maximum power given to the CPU
	  when the GPU has the priority.
	- GPU Priority GPU Max Frequency (kHz) (or Max Power (mW)): Maximum GPU
	  frequency (or power) allowed when the GPU has the priority. (See
	  nvidia,gpu_cap_as_mw).
	- GPU Priority EMC Max Frequency (kHz): Maximum EMC frequency allowed when
	  the GPU has the priority.
	- Throttle power (milliwatts): The amount of power returned to the system
	  when the SOC_THERM OC signal throttles the CPU and GPU frequencies.
	  This is the amount of power with 100% throttle depth.
  Note that the order of AP Power must start with the smallest power and
  should increase for each entry.
- nvidia,core_gain: The percentage of gain applied to the AP+DRAM budget power.
  A value of 100 means to multiply by 1.0.
- nvidia,init_req_watts defines the initial AP+DRAM budget before the
  sysedp_dynamic_capping gets a calculated budget from the sysedp module.
- nvidia,throttle_depth: The percentage of gain applied to the throttle power.
  A value of 100 means to multiply by 1.0.  Expected values are between 0-100%.
  This value should be matched to the HW SOC_THERM throttle depth choice.
- nvidia,cap_method: The calculation to use when determining which corecap
  entry is associated with the AP+DRAM budget. For systems with voltage
  comparators, the value should be 3.  For systems without voltage comparators,
  but with modem overcurrent signals, the value should be 2.  For all other
  systems, the value should be set to 1.

Optional properties:
- nvidia,gpu_cap_as_mw: if present, this property indicates that the
  GPU caps are power limits in mW as opposed to frequency limits in
  kHz

Example:
	sysedp-dynamic-capping {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra124-sysedp-dynamic-capping";
		nvidia,corecap = <
		   5000   2000 100000 933000   2000 100000 933000    500

		  20000  10000 500000 933000   5000 700000 933000   8000

		nvidia,core_gain = <100>;
		nvidia,init_req_watts = <20000>;
